A Python-based face recognition project that detects and identifies faces in images using machine learning. 🌟 Features include a web API for image uploads, real-time recognition, and modular design for easy integration. Ideal for security apps, attendance systems, or AI experiments! Built with libraries like face_recognition and Flask.  

## 🚀 Quick Start  

```bash
# Clone the repo  
git clone https://github.com/damthuyhien/Face-Recognition-Project.git  
cd Face-Recognition-Project  

# Set up virtual environment  
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  

# Install dependencies (add to requirements.txt: face_recognition, flask, opencv-python, etc.)  
pip install -r requirements.txt  

# Run the API server  
python app.py  

# Test the client  
python face_recognition_client.py  
```

```  

## 🛠️ Installation  

1. **Prerequisites** 🔧:  
   - Python 3.8+  
   - Libraries: face_recognition (for detection), Flask (for API), OpenCV (for image processing)  

2. **Setup** 📥:  
   ```bash
   pip install face_recognition flask opencv-python numpy  
   ```  

   Note: face_recognition requires dlib, which might need additional setup on some systems (e.g., CMake for building).  

## ▶️ Usage  

- **Run the API** 🏃‍♂️: Start the server with `python app.py`. It exposes endpoints like `/upload` for image submission.  
- **Recognize Faces** 🔍: Use `face_recognition_module.py` functions to process images from the `data/images` folder.  
- **Client Testing** 💻: Run `python face_recognition_client.py` to send sample requests to the API.  
- **Example Code** 📝:  
  ```python
  # In face_recognition_module.py (pseudo-code example)  
  import face_recognition  
  image = face_recognition.load_image_file("data/images/sample.jpg")  
  face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)  
  print(f"Found {len(face_locations)} faces! 👥")  
  ```
